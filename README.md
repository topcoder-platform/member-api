Set the following environment variables used by bus API to get TC M2M token (use 'set' insted of 'export' for Windows OS):
```
export AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=

export AUTH0_URL=
export AUTH0_AUDIENCE=
```

Also properly configure AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_REGION, PHOTO_S3_BUCKET, IS_LOCAL_DB config parameters.

Test configuration is at `config/test.js`. You don't need to change them.
The following test parameters can be set in config file or in env variables:

- ADMIN_TOKEN: admin token
- USER_TOKEN: user token
- EXPIRED_TOKEN: expired token
- INVALID_TOKEN: invalid token

- M2M_UPDATE_ACCESS_TOKEN: M2M update (including 'delete') access token
- S3_ENDPOINT: endpoint of AWS S3 API, for unit and e2e test only; default to `localhost:9000`

## AWS S3 Setup
Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/ and login. Choose S3 from Service folder and click `Create bucket`. Following the instruction to create S3 bucket.
After creating bucket, click `Permissions` tab of the bucket, in the `Block public access` section, disable the block, so that public access
is allowed, then we can upload public accessible photo to the bucket.

## Local services setup
In the `local` folder, run `docker-compose up`
It starts Elasticsearch, DynamoDB and S3 compatible server.

## Create Tables
1. Make sure DynamoDB are running as per instructions above.
2. Make sure you have configured all config parameters. Refer [Configuration](#configuration)
3. Run `npm run create-tables` to create tables.

## Scripts
1. Drop DB tables: `npm run drop-tables`
2. Create DB tables: `npm run create-tables`
3. Initialize/Clear database: `npm run init-db`
4. Create Opensearch index: `npm run init-es`, or to re-create index: `npm run init-es force`
5. Seed/Insert data to ES and DB: `npm run seed-data`
6. View DB table data: `npm run view-db-data <ModelName>`, ModelName can be `Member`, `MemberTrait`, `MemberDistributionStats`, `MemberHistoryStats`, `MemberStats`, `MemberSkill` or `MemberFinancial`
7. View ES data: `npm run view-es-data <IndexName>`, IndexName can be `member`, `member_trait`

## Local Deployment

- Install dependencies `npm install`
- Run lint `npm run lint`
- Run lint fix `npm run lint:fix`
- initialize Elasticsearch, create configured Elasticsearch index if not present: `npm run init-es`,
  or re-create the index: `npm run init-es force`
- Create tables `npm run create-tables`
- Clear and init db data `npm run init-db`
- Start app `npm start`
- App is running at `http://localhost:3000`

## Local Deployment with Docker

To run the app using docker, follow the below steps:

1. Navigate to the directory `docker`

2. Rename the file `sample.api.env` to `api.env`

3. Set the required AWS credentials in the file `api.env`, you may add more env variables to this file if needed

4. Once that is done, run the following command

```
docker-compose up
```

5. When you are running the application for the first time, It will take some time initially to download the image and install the dependencies


## Running tests

### Prepare
- Various config parameters should be properly set.
- Start Local services.
- Create DynamoDB tables.
- Initialize ES index.
- No need to seed test data, the tests should run in clean environment, if there are data in ES and DB, then clear them by running
  `npm run init-db` and `npm run init-es force`


### Running unit tests
To run unit tests alone

```bash
npm run test
```

To run unit tests with coverage report

```bash
npm run test:cov
```

### Running integration tests
To run integration tests alone

```bash
npm run e2e
```

To run integration tests with coverage report

```bash
npm run e2e:cov
```

## Verification
Refer to the verification document `Verification.md`

## Notes

- all JWT tokens provided in Postman environment file and tests are created in `https://jwt.io` with secret `mysecret`
- you don't need to setup the (https://github.com/topcoder-platform/member-processor-es),
  because there is seed-data script to setup data to test the members API,
  the tests also have setup data properly
- the tests use mock S3 service, so you may use the provided mock AWS credential for tests,
  but Postman tests require using real AWS S3, you need to follow above to create S3 bucket and provide your own AWS credential
  so that the upload photo API works
